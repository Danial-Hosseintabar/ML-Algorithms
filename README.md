# Introduction
I'm implementing some Machine Learning Algorithms in form of little tools in this repository, some have graphics as well.
Graphical tools are mostly implemented using `Javascript`, `CSS`, `HTML`.
Non-Graphical tools are mostly implemented in `C++` and `Python`.

# Linear Regression
## Linear Regression Visualizer
A tool you can see the Gradient Descent Algorithm with your own eyes.

## General Linear Regression
A C++ program which will find the closest linear function which has the condition : $$f : R^n \rightarrow R \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ( n \in \mathbb{Z}^+ )$$ for any any and any number of datas. It uses Gradient descent algorithm.
