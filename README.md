# Introduction
I'm implementing some Machine Learning Algorithms in form of little tools in this repository, some have graphics as well.
Graphical tools are mostly implemented using `Javascript`, `CSS`, `HTML`.
Non-Graphical tools are mostly implemented in `C++` and `Python`.

# Linear Regression
## Gradient Descent
Linear Regression Visualizer: a tool you can see the Gradient Descent Algorithm with your own eyes.
